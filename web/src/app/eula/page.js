                Rever may provide any notice to the End-User under this EULA by
                sending a message to the email address associated with the
                End-User&apos;s account. Such notices sent via email will be
                effective when sent. It is the responsibility of the End-User to
                ensure that their email address is kept current. The End-User
                will be deemed to have received any email sent to the email
                address then associated with their account at the time of
                transmission, regardless of whether the End-User actually
                receives the email. To give Rever notice under this EULA, the
                End-User must contact Rever via email support@reverfin.ai
