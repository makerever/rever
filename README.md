### Evolution of Rever

Over a decade of building Virtual CFO practices taught us two things:
Every growing business has non-standard financial processes

Every standard reporting tool struggles to turn them into actionable insights

The result? Fragmented systems. Overburdened accountants. Missed opportunities.
Rever was born to fix this — an AI-enabled Finance Copilot that simplifies, streamlines, and supercharges the modern finance function.
